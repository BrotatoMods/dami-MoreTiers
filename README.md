# dami - MoreTiers

Little utility mod that allows modders to add tier 5 and tier 6 items, weapons and upgrades

This mod does nothing by itself. It is a dependency for mods that add Tier 5 and 6 content into the game.

It's recommended that you use ContentLoader alongside it to make adding content easier

All you need to do is add your items normally like you would without this.
The mod will make sure your tier 5 and 6 items are added the same way the other tiers are.

If you're adding Tier 5 weapons that are upgrades of Tier 4 (legendaries), you only need to give it the right weapon_id. The mod will then add it to the upgrade path

I've also changed the color of Tier 5 (orange) because I find it kinda funny in vanilla
